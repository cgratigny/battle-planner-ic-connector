# README

This is a simple project that synchronizes users for a Flutter app. This reads an API on Podio, then presents a json feed for the app to connect to.

This also reads data from firestore, syncing it and displaying the tracking information on a web view. This part of the app is less developed, as Rails isn't the best way to communicate with firestore.
